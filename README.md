nfrac
=====


*nfrac* is a Python program that generates newton fractals in the complex plane.

It was built as a final project in AP Calculus BC at the North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics.

### Note:
This project is no longer under development. The original goal was to gain a mathematical understanding of Newton Fractals in the complex plane, and developing a GUI is not beneficial to those goals.
